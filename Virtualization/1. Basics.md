**why virtual memory?**
- RAM: limited memory

### KVM
Kernel-based Virtual Machine
- virtualization 
- turn Linux into a hypervisor that allows a host machine to run multiple isolated virtual environments called guests or virtual machines(VMs).

**hypervisor**: Linux machine -> Mac/Windows  

**goddside**: 
- backup & restore when install some tools on Linux
    - take a snapshot of the VM before running the install
    - revert if something goes wrong
- simplify tesing and bug fixing
    - clone a working VM into multiple environments 
**other hypervisor**:
- VirtualBox
- VMware
- Hyper-V

``` egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo```  

``` sudo dnf install @virtualization```

1. qemu-kvm: the emulator itself
2. libvirt-daemon: runs virtualization in background
3. bridge-utils: important networking dependencies
4. virt-manager: the graphical program we'ill use to work with VMs.

## Container
A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. It’s a bit like a virtual machine, but more lightweight. Instead of virtualizing the entire hardware, containers virtualize the operating system, making them more portable and efficient.  

A **Container file** is a configuration file that automates the steps of creating a container image. It’s similar to a Dockerfile and can be used with *container engines* like *Docker or Podman*. The Container file contains instructions on how to build the **container image**, which includes the base image to use, the software to install, the ports to expose, etc.

A **Linux distribution**, often abbreviated as distro, is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and often a package management system1. It’s a complete operating system that includes the Linux kernel, a collection of user applications, utilities, and libraries.  
Examples of popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch Linux.  Alpine and OpenSUSE are both Linux distributions. Alpine is designed to be small, simple, and secure5. It’s often used in containers due to its small size and quick boot-up times5. OpenSUSE is another Linux distribution, known for its user-friendliness and versatility. 


**image**

1. **Digital Image**: A digital image is a binary representation of visual information, such as drawings, pictures, graphs, logos, or individual video frames¹. It's made up of tiny squares known as pixels⁵. Each pixel represents the color and intensity at a certain point in the image⁶. When an image is digitized to be stored on a computer, it's turned into a set of pixels⁵.

2. **System Image**: A system image is a serialized copy of the entire state of a computer system stored in some non-volatile form such as a file². It can be used for backup or to restore the system to a previous state².

3. **Container Image**: In the context of containers (like Docker or Podman), an image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files¹.

How images work depends on the type of image:

- **Digital images** work by representing visual information as a grid of pixels. Each pixel has a value that represents its color and intensity⁶. This allows computers to store and manipulate visual information in a format they can understand⁵.

- **System images** work by storing the state of a computer system at a particular point in time. This can include the state of the operating system, installed applications, system settings, and user files².

- **Container images** work by packaging software and its dependencies into a standardized unit. This image can be used to create containers, which are isolated environments where the software can run¹.



## Internet connection of VM
![network](pics/network.png)
How does Virt-Manager put NAT to use?  
After we install qemu kvm, we got two new vitual hardware devices: a virtual router and a virtual switch
- vitual network
    - default: its own virtual router 
    - its hosts(the virtual machine) gets their IPs from DHCP service in this virtual router 
- virtual switch
    - to be able to connect more virtual machines to the virtual router  (allows more devices in the same network/allows more virtual machines in the same virtual router)

**virbr0**: virtual bridge(virtual switch)
- virbr0-nic: the bridge at least has one network device
    - bridge itself has an ip within the range of virtual router DHCP 
- each running virtual machine wil add one vnet entry

# Difference between NET and Bridge network
- bridge network doesn't use a virtual router, create a new switch and attach a physical nic as a slave to the switch.
- get their iP from physical router
