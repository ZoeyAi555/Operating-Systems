**Inter-process communication (IPC)** is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions¹². The communication between these processes can be seen as a method of cooperation between them¹. Processes can communicate with each other through both shared memory and message passing¹.

In the context of locks, IPC is crucial. For instance, when using shared storage, a producer should gain an exclusive lock on the file before writing to it³. An exclusive lock can be held by one process at most, which rules out a race condition because no other process can access the file until the lock is released³. A consumer should gain at least a shared lock on the file before reading from it³.

Here are some common methods of IPC:

1. **Shared Memory**: Communication between processes using shared memory requires processes to share some variable¹. It completely depends on how the programmer will implement it¹.

2. **Message Passing**: This involves sending and receiving messages between processes¹.

3. **Semaphores**: Semaphores are a common method of interprocess communication². They are used for programs to communicate data to each other and to synchronize their activities².

4. **Message Queues**: Internal message queues are another common method of interprocess communication².

Remember, IPC is a method for two or more separate programs or processes to communicate with each other². This avoids using real disk-based files and the associated I/O overhead to pass information². Like a file, you must first create or open the resource, use it, and close it². Unlike real disk-based files, semaphores, message queues, and shared memory do not persist across reboots².
