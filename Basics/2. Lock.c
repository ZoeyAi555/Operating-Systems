wait(mutex)
Release mutex, add thread to waiting set, go to sleep.  After waking, re-acquire mutex (blocking if needed).
Each condition variable is associated with a lock
Invariant must be true when releasing lock

signal() and broadcast()
Wake up one thread (signal) or all threads (broadcast) that are waiting on this condition variable
If no thread is waiting, signal/broadcast does nothing
