## Mounting
Each logical partition or drive needs to be assigned to a specific directory on Linux. This process is called mounting. Mounting involves attaching a drive to a specific directory, making it accessible to the file system hierarchy. Once a drive is mounted, it can be accessed and manipulated just like any other directory on the system. The mount tool is used to mount file systems on Linux, and the /etc/fstab file is used to define the default file systems that are mounted at boot time.
