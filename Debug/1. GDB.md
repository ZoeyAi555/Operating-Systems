## GDB
**gdb basic usage**:
1. compile your code
- ```gcc -g yourcode.c -o output```  
- ```./output```  
2. Load the execuatble into GDB
- ```gdb ./your_project.exe```
**use ```control + x + a```**  
3. breakpoints
- (gdb) ```break foo.cpp:25```
- (gdb)``` break main()```
- (gdb)``` break 25```
- (gdb)``` break MyClass::bar```
4. run the executable
- (gdb)``` run```
- (gdb)``` run --arg 0.3 > output```
- (gdb)``` r 0.3 > output```
5. inspect
- (gdb) ```bt```
- (gdb) ```p my_var```
- (gdb) ```list```
- (gdb) ```next```
- (gdb) ```continue```

**gdb basic usage in debugging kernel**:
1. compile your code
2. complile your own kernel  
- make sure you have a ```vmlinux``` file (all the kernel info we need, like the debug info)
3. enable certain feature in your kernel config
- ```CONFIG_GDB_SCRIPTS```
4. ```sudo gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore```

GDB stops your kernel at certain point: break



**gdb commands**:
- ```b```(set breakpoint)
    - ```b main()```
    - ```b main.cpp:12```
    - ```b MyClass::~MyClass()```
- ```dis n```(disable breakpoint)
    - ```dis 1```(`1` is breakpoint number)
- ``` en n```(enable breakpoint)
- ```del n```(delete breakpoint)
- ```r args``` (run or restart)
    ```r --num_cpus 4```
- ```kill ```
- ```s```(step into a function)
- ```s n```(step n times)
- ```n n```(next n times, stepover functions)
- ```c```(continue until next breakpoint)
- ```p expr```(print)
- ```i topic``` (info)
    - ```i b ```(list breakpoints)
    - ```i thr```(list threads)
- ``` f```(frame)
    - view current line
- ```list```(list code)
    - view nearby code lines
- ```bt``` (view the call stack)
- ```up n```(up n frames,less recent)
- ```down n```(down n frames,more recent)
- ```thr n```(switch to thread)
- ```cond n expr```(conditional breakpoints)
    - ```cond 1 (i>=4)```
- Automatic breakpoint commands, Allow you to perform specific actions every time a breakpoint is hit.
    - ```
    (gdb) $ break main.cpp:44
    (gdb) $ commands
    > backtrace
    > print var
    > end

    ```

- ```help```
- ```lay next```(read assembly)
- ```break 6```(add breakpoint in the 6th line)
- ``` run ```
- ```refresh```
- ```info```(get info from specific area of the kernel)
- hit ```tab``` twice, it will return all the matching commands

- man gdb

**Example:**  
debugging memory map minimum addr  
- (gdb)```info address mmap_min_addr```  : Symbol "mmap_min_addr"  is static storage at address 0xfffffff82df6288
- (gdb)```print /x mmap_min_addr```  : $1 = 0x0 (sercurity reason for kernel, it won't show the memory map)
- (gdb)```print /d mmap_min_addr```  : $2 = 0
- (in your linux evironment)```cat /proc/kallsyms | grep mmap_min_addr```: 
0000000 T mmap_min_adr_handler  
0000000 D mmap_min_addr  
0000000 t init_mmap_min_addr  
0000000 d __initcall_kmod_min_addr__252_53_init_mmap_min_addr0  
0000000 B mmap_min_addr  
- (gdb)```print /x fixed_percpu_data```  : $3 = {gs base = {0x0 <repeats 40 times>},stack_canary = 0x0} // we find something! the fixed_percpu_data get executed 40 times in kernel
- **(gdb)```lx -```**: almost everything you need for debugging! 
    - ```dmesg```
    - ```cmdline```
    - ```cpus``` info about cpus
    - ```symbols```
    - ```device-list-bus```
    - ```configdump```

# Core dumps
- snapshot of program's state,debug non-deterministic (i.e. hard to reproduce) bugs
- you can call gdb to load your coredumps  

**create core dumps**

```
ulimit -c unlimited   
./your_program.exe   
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
the generated coredumps appear in /var/lib/systemd/coredump/ as an lz4 compressed file  
to uncompress: ```unlz4 /var/lib/systemd/coredump/core.PROGRAM.lz4 OUTPUT-FILENAME```
**View core dumps in GDB by running**
- ```gdb ./your_program.exe -c core.12345``` (Usually named something like core or core.12345, where 12345 was the Process ID (PID) of the program you ran)
