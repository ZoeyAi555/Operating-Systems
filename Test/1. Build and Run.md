 The Linux kernel provides a set of "self-tests" to exercise individual code paths in the kernel¹. Here's how you can run your test file:

1. **Place your test file in the kernel source tree**: The directory should have a Makefile¹. Add the line `obj-y += YourModule.o` to this Makefile¹.

2. **Build the tests**: Run the following commands in your terminal²:
    ```
    $ make headers
    $ make -C tools/testing/selftests
    ```

3. **Run the tests**: Use the following command²:
    ```
    $ make -C tools/testing/selftests run_tests
    ```

4. **Build and run with a single command**: You can also build and run the tests with a single command²:
    ```
    $ make kselftest
    ```
